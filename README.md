Packet, a packing list app.
pack·it

Welcome to the packing list solution.

Ever stood in front of your closet and wondered what to pack? Maybe stared at your bathroom cabinets, hoping you remembered everything you need? Left to the airport without your laptop charger?

Packet remembers everything you’ve packed in the past, as well as helps you keep a running list of what you’d like to bring, and includes a helpful checkmark feature to help you track what you’ve packed so far. You can add an item from scratch, or click the “+” button to select from past items from a drop-down. 

You can manage all your past Items from your Items Library, such as update items, add them to a list directly from the Items Library view, and delete old items you may not own anymore, as well as add new items.
